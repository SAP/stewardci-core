/*
Package testing provides utilities for tests that depend on
feature flags.

Feature flags are shared state. When tests change feature flags,
they must ensure that no other tests are affected.

1. They must restore the default feature flag state when the
   test is finished.

2. They must not run in parallel with other tests that could be
   affected by changed feature flags state.

WithFeatureFlag sets the given feature flag to the given state and
returns a reset function to revert to the previous feature flag state.

The returned function is meant to be called deferred by the caller.
