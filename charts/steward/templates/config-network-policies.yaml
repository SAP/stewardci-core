    # _default is a special key that denotes the _key_ of the network policy in this
    # config map that should be applied for pipeline runs that do _not_ explicitly
    # choose one.
    _default: policy1

    # Any other key defines a network policy.
    #
    # Steward clients can select the network policy for individual pipeline runs via their
    # keys, so keys should be chosen appropriately.
    #
    # The value must be a complete `networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io` resource manifest
    # in YAML format.
    # The `.metadata` section of the manifest can be omitted, as it will be replaced anyway.
    #
    # See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/
    # for details about Kubernetes network policies.
    #
    # Note that Steward ensures that all pods in pipeline run namespaces are
    # _isolated_ in terms of network policies. The policies defined here _add_
    # egress and/or ingress rules.

    # Example policy 1 (for illustration purposes only)
