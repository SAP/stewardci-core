      title: Remove default 1m value from the Helmchart and rename the parameter
      description: |-
        - Default value should not be overwritten in the Helmchart but in the consumer of this Helmchart.
          Hence 1m value is removed so that 15m default timeout is set if consumer does not set it explicitely.
        - Rename command-line parameter `server-request-timeout` for the run controller to `k8s-api-request-timeout`
        - Rename command-line parameter `server-request-timeout` for the tenant controller to `k8s-api-request-timeout`
        - Rename Helm Chart values in the `values.yaml` file from `runController.serverRequestTimeout` to `runController.k8sAPIRequestTimeout`
        - Rename Helm Chart values in the `values.yaml` file from `tenantController.serverRequestTimeout` to `tenantController.k8sAPIRequestTimeout`
      upgradeNotes: |-
        - In the previous version `0.18.0` default value of 1m is set in the Helmchart for `server-request-timeout` for both run- and tenant-controllers
        which are wrong. This release removes the default value of 1m in the Helmchart to be set by the consumer of the Helmchart.
        - Please rename `runController.serverRequestTimeout` to `runController.k8sAPIRequestTimeout` inside consumer's `values.yaml` file.
        - Please rename `tenantController.serverRequestTimeout` to `tenantController.k8sAPIRequestTimeout` inside consumer's `values.yaml` file.

      title: Make K8s API connection timeout configurable
      description: |-
        When stewardci-core hits a network issue when connecting to API server, it will only recover after 15 min when the default timeout occurs.
        To improve the situation the timeout should be configurable. Following parameters are added now for run- and tenant-controllers:
          - Add command-line parameter `server-request-timeout` for the run controller
          - Add command-line parameter `server-request-timeout` for the tenant controller
          - Make `server-request-timeout` command-line parameter of run controller configurable in the Helmchart via `runController.serverRequestTimeout`
          - Make `server-request-timeout` command-line parameter of tenant controller configurable in the Helmchart via `tenantController.serverRequestTimeout`

      title: Remove use of deprecated K8s APIs
      description: |-
        Steward used some Kubernetes API versions that are deprecated in newer
        Kubernetes releases.
        The following replacements have been applied:
        - `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` → `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`
        - `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1` → `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`
      warning: |-
        -   Steward does no longer run on Kubernetes v1.15 or below.

        -   Rolling back to an earlier version of Steward might fail.

            All Steward releases up to v0.16.0 have a bug in the CRD update
            hook of the Helm chart.
            Using `helm rollback` or `helm upgrade` with such target version
            will fail.

            The problem has been fixed in Steward v0.16.1 and higher.
            Rolling back to an earlier version can be achieved by first rolling
            back to v0.16.1 and then to the desired target version.

      title: "Helm chart: Fix CRD updates"
      description: |-
        So far `kubectl apply` has been used to create or update
        CRDs.
        But in case of updating an existing CRD the result may be
        a mixture of existing and new CRD that is possibly broken.

        Now `kubectl create` and `kubectl replace` are used instead.

      description: |-
        Steward uses Tekton to run JFR pods for pipeline runs.
        The respective ClusterTask contains a pod template that does _not_ specify
        the entrypoint of the JFR container.
        Therefore Tekton tries to obtain the entrypoint by downloading the
        container image manifest from the registry.
        This may fail if the registry's rate limit is exceeded.
        As a workaround, specify the JFR container entrypoint in the ClusterTask.

        policies should be used by pipeline run pods and Steward controllers:

        - `pipelineRuns.podSecurityPolicyName`
        - `tenantController.podSecurityPolicyName`
        - `runController.podSecurityPolicyName`

        If such parameters are _not_ specified, the chart generates default
        pod security policies as before.

        See the chart README for details.

    type: enhancement

    description: |-
      In the future Steward will be enabled to provision service instances
      per pipeline run, e.g. a pipeline log forwarder.
      This change introduces auxiliary pipeline run namespaces where
      those run-specific service instances are defined in Kubernetes.

      The pattern of pipeline run namespace names changes.

      By default auxiliary namespaces are not created because they are not
      used yet. Enabling the feature flag `CreateAuxNamespaceIfUnused`
      enforces creating auxiliary namespaces.

      Allow Steward clients to select a network profile per pipeline run.

      Network profiles are named network-related configurations defined by Steward operators.
      Currently they define a Kubernetes network policy. Additional network-related settings may be

      Clients can choose a network profile via `spec.profiles.network` of a PipelineRun
      resource object.

      - PiplineRun objects may now have a `status.result` value `error_config` (see Steward API docs).
      - Activating the new feature flag `RetryOnInvalidPipelineRunsConfig` will let the pipeline run controller retry reconciling in case the controller configuration (in ConfigMaps) is invalid or cannot be loaded. Without the feature flag all PipelineRun objects will be set to finished with result code `error_infra`. The new behaviour will become the default in a future release of Steward.
