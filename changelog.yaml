    title: Make elasticSearch IndexURL configurable in PipelineRun custom resource objects.
    description: >-
      There exists a default elasticSearch IndexURL per cluster. It reduces flexibility to
      push logs to different indeces in elasticSearch. This change allows developers to
      make elasticSearch IndexURL configurable in Steward-PipelineRun object as a parameter.

  - title: Introduce feature flags
    type: internal
    impact: patch
    description: |-

      with feature flags in Steward controllers.
      Feature flags can be configured via Helm Chart.

    impact: minor
    title: Introduce network profiles
    description: |-
      Allow Steward clients to select a network profile per pipeline run.

      Network profiles are named network-related configurations defined by Steward operators.
      Currently they define a Kubernetes network policy. Additional network-related settings may be
      added in the future.

      Clients can choose a network profile via `spec.profiles.network` of a PipelineRun
      resource object.
    warning: ""
    upgradeNotes: |-
      - PiplineRun objects may now have a `status.result` value `error_config` (see Steward API docs).
      - Activating the new feature flag `RetryOnInvalidPipelineRunsConfig` will let the pipeline run controller retry reconciling in case the controller configuration (in ConfigMaps) is invalid or cannot be loaded. Without the feature flag all PipelineRun objects will be set to finished with result code `error_infra`. The new behaviour will become the default in a future release of Steward.
    deprecations: |-
      Helm configuration value `pipelineRuns.networkPolicy` is deprecated:
      use `pipelineRuns.networkPolicies` instead.
