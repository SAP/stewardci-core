      - do not trim whitespace from configured network policies, as it may destroy YAML wellformedness
      - fail loading the pipeline runs configuration if the network policies config map does not exist
      - give more precise error messages in case of erroneous pipeline runs configuration
      - lots of refactoring in `pkg/runctl/cfg`

  - title: Introduce feature flags
    type: internal
    impact: patch
    description: |-
      There's a new Go package `pkg/featureflag` to deal
      with feature flags in Steward controllers.
      Feature flags can be configured via Helm Chart.

  - type: enhancement
    impact: minor
    title: Introduce network profiles
    description: |-
      Allow Steward clients to select a network profile per pipeline run.

      Network profiles are named network-related configurations defined by Steward operators.
      Currently they define a Kubernetes network policy. Additional network-related settings may be
      added in the future.

      Clients can choose a network profile via `spec.profiles.network` of a PipelineRun
      resource object.
    warning: ""
    upgradeNotes: |-
      - PiplineRun objects may now have a `status.result` value `error_config` (see Steward API docs).
      - Activating the new feature flag `RetryOnInvalidPipelineRunsConfig` will let the pipeline run controller retry reconciling in case the controller configuration (in ConfigMaps) is invalid or cannot be loaded. Without the feature flag all PipelineRun objects will be set to finished with result code `error_infra`. The new behaviour will become the default in a future release of Steward.
    deprecations: |-
      Helm configuration value `pipelineRuns.networkPolicy` is deprecated:
      use `pipelineRuns.networkPolicies` instead.
