        The elasticsearch plugin of the JFR had an internal bug that is now fixed with

      title: Introduce switch for usage of tenants and clients 
      description: |-
        Steward is providing a client/tenant concept which can be used.
        It is also possible to use Steward without client namespaces and tenants and use plain k8s namespaces instead. 
        This change provides a possibility to disable the usage of tenants and client namespaces in the helm chart.
        This results in less resource consumption on the k8s cluster by saving one controller.

      title: Enable log forwarding
      description: |-
        We want to add support for log-forwarders (i.e. fluentd) instead of sending logs directly to OpenSearch/ElasticSearch.
        For this purpose, two configuration extension are prepared:

        * Set environment variables to configure the elasticsearch-log-plugin to forward data to fluentd
        * Enable the use of tekton sidecars. This can be used to run the forwarder as a sidecar container in the JFR pod
      upgradeNotes: |-
        The change does not affect the current behavior as long as the new configuration options are not used.

        In order to use log forwarding, a version of the JFR image later than "230426_ed390b3" is required.

      title: Use K8s auto-mount of service account token
      description: |-
        Instead of configuring a volume for the service account token,
        Steward now just sets `automountServiceAccountToken` to true
        so that Kubernetes takes care for the token injection.
        During the prepare phase of pipeline runs Steward no longer waits
        for service account token secrets to be created by Kubernetes.

      title: Fix start time of phase "running"
      description: |-
        The start time of phase "running" was set to the start time of the
        Tekton TaskRun for JFR, which is when the pod has been _created_.
        But phase "waiting" now covers the time until successful start-up
        of the containers in the pod, which can be significantly after pod
        creation, e.g. due to image pull time.
        Therefore, the start time of phase "running" is now the start time
        of the the JRF container.

  changes:
    - type: internal
      impact: minor
      title: Retry on ImagePullBackOff
      description: |-
        Since Tekton v0.41.0 TaskRuns fail if the corresponding pod is subject to
        image pull back-off ([#4921](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4921).
        In case of transient image pull failures this can fail Steward PipelineRun
        processing (`error_infra`).

        Steward now detects aborted TaskRuns due to ImagePullBackOff and retries with
        a new TaskRun for a configurable period (`waitTimeout`).
        This happens in the 'waiting' phase of Steward PipelineRun processing.

        Steward used some Kubernetes API versions that are deprecated in newer
        Kubernetes releases.
        The following replacements have been applied:
        - `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` → `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`
        - `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1` → `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`
      warning: |-
        -   Steward does no longer run on Kubernetes v1.15 or below.

        -   Rolling back to an earlier version of Steward might fail.

            All Steward releases up to v0.16.0 have a bug in the CRD update
            hook of the Helm chart.
            Using `helm rollback` or `helm upgrade` with such target version
            will fail.

            The problem has been fixed in Steward v0.16.1 and higher.
            Rolling back to an earlier version can be achieved by first rolling
            back to v0.16.1 and then to the desired target version.

      Jenkinsfile Runner container entrypoint retries cloning the pipeline

    title: Introduce network profiles
    description: |-
      Allow Steward clients to select a network profile per pipeline run.

      Network profiles are named network-related configurations defined by Steward operators.
      Currently they define a Kubernetes network policy. Additional network-related settings may be
      added in the future.

      Clients can choose a network profile via `spec.profiles.network` of a PipelineRun
      resource object.
    warning: ""
    upgradeNotes: |-
      - PiplineRun objects may now have a `status.result` value `error_config` (see Steward API docs).
      - Activating the new feature flag `RetryOnInvalidPipelineRunsConfig` will let the pipeline run controller retry reconciling in case the controller configuration (in ConfigMaps) is invalid or cannot be loaded. Without the feature flag all PipelineRun objects will be set to finished with result code `error_infra`. The new behaviour will become the default in a future release of Steward.

      Helm configuration value `pipelineRuns.networkPolicy` is deprecated:
