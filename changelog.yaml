         short period of time with an invalid state

        - `runController.podSecurityPolicyName`

        If such parameters are _not_ specified, the chart generates default
        pod security policies as before.

  - title: Introduce auxiliary pipeline run namespaces
    type: enhancement
    impact: patch
    description: |-
      In the future Steward will be enabled to provision service instances
      per pipeline run, e.g. a pipeline log forwarder.
      This change introduces auxiliary pipeline run namespaces where
      those run-specific service instances are defined in Kubernetes.

      The pattern of pipeline run namespace names changes.

      By default auxiliary namespaces are not created because they are not
      used yet. Enabling the feature flag `CreateAuxNamespaceIfUnused`
      enforces creating auxiliary namespaces.

    title: Introduce network profiles
    description: |-
      Allow Steward clients to select a network profile per pipeline run.

      Network profiles are named network-related configurations defined by Steward operators.
      Currently they define a Kubernetes network policy. Additional network-related settings may be
      added in the future.

      Clients can choose a network profile via `spec.profiles.network` of a PipelineRun
      resource object.
    warning: ""
    upgradeNotes: |-
      - PiplineRun objects may now have a `status.result` value `error_config` (see Steward API docs).
      - Activating the new feature flag `RetryOnInvalidPipelineRunsConfig` will let the pipeline run controller retry reconciling in case the controller configuration (in ConfigMaps) is invalid or cannot be loaded. Without the feature flag all PipelineRun objects will be set to finished with result code `error_infra`. The new behaviour will become the default in a future release of Steward.
